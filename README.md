# Text-Classification

I have Implemented Naive Bayes on my own to classify the 20000 documents into 20 categories.
The 20 categories are as follows : 
- Athiesm
- graphics
- OS - Windows
- IBM - PC Hardware
- Mac Hardware
- Windows X
- For Sale
- Autos
- Motorcycles
- Baseball
- Hockey
- Cryptography
- Electronics
- Medicine
- Space
- Religion - Christian
- Guns
- Mideast
- Politics - Miscellanious
- Religion - Miscellanious


The accuracy obtained by my Naive Bayes algorithm is 82%. The scikit-learn implementation of Naive Bayes gives 80% accuracy.
